# Introduction

### what is graph-lib

Graph-lib is a secondary encapsulation based on maxgraph, which simplifies the use of API, adds documentation, and sample code. The project is built with monorepo + pnpm + rollup. Tree shaking is supported. Each module of maxgraph is extracted into a separate library and installed on demand to reduce the project volume.
